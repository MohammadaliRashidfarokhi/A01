Template for Assignment 01 (A01).


1. Did you know and/or had used HTML and CSS before this assignment?
Yes, I have purchased a course from the udemy which was about HTML and CSS. Back then, I have created a personal project based on the Vikings series. It was a simple web page.
However, I only knew the basics.

2. Briefly explain, in your own words, HTML to a person who has never heard of it before.
Simply speaking, HTML is a programming language that is one of the essentials of web programming languages. It will construct website sections. For example, it has a body, header, and footer tag.
Tag is an identifier that will enable the programmer to choose a suitable tag when it comes to constructing. However, HTML without CSS is basic and not appealing.

3. Briefly explain, with your own words, about CSS to a person who has never heard of it before
CSS without HTML is not going to work. That is, firstly it should be constructed. Therefore, as soon as we have access to the HTML code, we can design the page and make it more appealing.
Mainly the CSS will use id and class to connect to HTML.

4. Elaborate on the importance of keeping HTML (markup and content) and CSS (style and layout) as two separate items. Is it important and in that case why? Can it be completely separated or do they somehow depend on each other?

I prefer to separate my HTML and CSS apart from each other. The reason is that it will not become messy and your code will be more organized. However, you can also style the HTML file within the HTML file. In case of separation,
you can easily link the files together.

5. What is your first impression of JavaScript as a programming language?

Essential. What I mean by this is that web programming without JavaScript is not a good idea. Although you can use just CSS and HTML, the page will be super simple. The JavaScript will enable us to interact with the web page. For example,
you can create input and by using JavaScript, you can make a connection between the client and the server.


6. Can you compare JavaScript as a programming language with other languages you know. Do you see equalities and differences?

As I have used Java language in my previous courses, there is plenty of similarity between Java and JavaScript. However, I think JavaScript is an easy-going language compare to Java.
On the other hand, there are differences as well. For example, in Java, you need to specify the type of the variable but in JavaScript, there is no need for doing that.

7. What is your opinion about the popularity of JavaScript? Can you see (or elaborate on the reasons) why it became popular or do you think that its popularity is overestimated? In your humble opinion?
There is no surprise that JavaScript is very popular. I think the reason is that since we are living in a modern society, everything now is being done online and the demand for JavaScript is rising.
Although other languages will be used as well, for the GUI, JavaScript will be used. 

8. Elaborate on how you opted to organize your JavaScript code in the assignment.

Most importantly, I have followed the assignment's description step by step. That is why I had a clear vision of what I am going to do. The game was similar to me since I have created the HangMan game before.
Mainly, I have inserted my code in a function to make it more clear. However, there is one method called Operator() where I have written the codes inside that. The reason is that this function is connected to a button that will do most of the job. Moving on, the rest of the methods are based on the assignment's requirements.

9. What is your TIL for this course part?

It helped to get to know JavaScript. I was not familiar with JavaScript that much. However, this assignment has helped me to know the basic operations of JavaScript. Apart from that,
I only knew the basics of HTML and CSS but thanks to this assignment I have learned a lot. For example, I never designed a navigation bar or responsive page, etc. Consequently, I got the chance to design them.
